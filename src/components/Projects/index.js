                        In my classes, I have mostly
                        been learning theory that's helped me build a foundation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, outside of school I've been dabbling in both web development and machine learning. 
                        I really like machine learning, especially NLP, since a popular use case is translations.
                        Lately, I've been trying to learn languages and linguistics, and the two fields are so interconnected.

                        Without further ado, here's what I've been working on lately:

                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="projects-list">
                    <Project 
                        image={portfolio}
                        link="/"
                        title="My Portfolio Project"
                        description="This is my personal portfolio that you're on right now!
                        I wanted to learn some web development, and I figured a website would be
                        the best way to go! More tabs and features will be added in the future so
                        keep a look outðŸ˜Ž!"
